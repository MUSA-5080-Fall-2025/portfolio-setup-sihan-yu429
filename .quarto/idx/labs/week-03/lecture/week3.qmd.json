dimensions, variable types, missing data\n2. **Assess reliability** - examine margins of error, calculate coefficients of variation\n3. **Visualize distributions** - histograms, boxplots for each variable\n4. **Explore relationships** - scatter plots, correlations\n5. **Identify patterns** - grouping, clustering, geographical patterns\n6. **Question anomalies** - investigate outliers and unusual patterns\n7. **Document limitations** -

Explicitly acknowledge omission  \n3. **Provide context for (un)reliability** - Use coefficient of variation (CV):\n   - CV < 12% = reliable (green coding)\n   - CV 12-40% = somewhat reliable (yellow)\n   - CV > 40% = unreliable (red coding)\n4. **Reduce statistical uncertainty** - Collapse data detail, aggregate geographies, use multi-year estimates\n5. **Always conduct statistical significance tests** when comparing ACS estimates over time\n\n**Key insight:** These practices are not just technical best practices—they are **ethical requirements** under the AICP Code of Ethics\n\n## EDA for Policy Analysis\n\n**Key questions for census data:**\n\n- **Geographic patterns:** Are problems concentrated in certain areas?\n- **Population relationships:** How does size affect data quality?\n- **Demographic patterns:** Are certain communities systematically different?\n- **Temporal trends:** How do patterns change over time?\n- **Data integrity:** Where might survey bias affect results?\n- **Reliability assessment:** Which estimates should we trust?\n\n---\n\n# Part 4: Data Joins & Integration\n\n## Why Join Data?\n\n**To combining datasets of course:**\n\n- Census demographics + Economic indicators\n- Survey responses + Geographic boundaries  \n- Current data + Historical trends\n- Administrative records + Survey data\n\n## Types of Joins (tabular)\n\n**Four main types in dplyr:**\n\n- `left_join()` -
