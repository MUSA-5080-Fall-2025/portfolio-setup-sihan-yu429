area\n- st_touches()\tShare boundary, no interior overlap\t“Neighboring counties”\n- st_within()\tCompletely inside\t“Schools within district boundaries”\n- st_contains()\tCompletely contains\t“Districts containing hospitals”\n- st_overlaps()\tPartial overlap\t“Overlapping service areas”\n- st_disjoint()\tNo spatial relationship\t“Counties separate from urban areas”\n- st_centroid() the center of one polygon\n- st_buffer(allegheny_center, dist = 50000) within the distance of a certain point\n- st_filter equal to a spatial selection\n  eg. st_filter(allegheny, .predicate = st_within)\n- union: like dissolve, merge few object into one record  \n- placeholder: dot(.) , represents the data being passed through the pipe (%>%) \n\n- *intersection* and *union* creates new shapes\n\n### Checking and Setting CRS\n- To simply check current CRS: st_crs(pa_counties)\n\n- To set CRS (ONLY if missing): pa_counties <- st_set_crs(pa_counties, 4326)\n  *write or rewrite metadata\n\n- Transform to different CRS\n  Pennsylvania South State Plane (good for PA analysis):\n  pa_counties_projected <- pa_counties %>%   st_transform(crs = 3365)\n\n- Transform to Albers Equal Area (good for area calculations) pa_counties_albers <- pa_counties %>%   st_transform(crs = 5070) `\n## Questions & Challenges\n- Which file I should go to when I make changes\n- The whole process of making changes\n\n## Connections to Policy\n- Upload my work to my portfolio for visualization\n\n## Reflection\n- How different platform can connect and work with each other\n- I want to practice more and dig deeper\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"week-04-notes.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
