## Key Concepts Learned
###Importance of Visualization###
  Anscombe's Quartet: The dataset with identical summary statistics, but completely different patterns when visualized.
###policy implications### 
  Summary statistics can hide critical patterns
  Outliers may represent important communities
  Relationships arenâ€™t always linear
  Visual inspection reveals data quality issues
###ethical data communication###
  Create honest, transparent visualizations
  Always assess and communicate data quality
  Consider who might be harmed by uncertain data
    
*Big MOE*: small sample size/ a large variation in the sample 

## Coding Techniques
###ggplots philosophy###
  grammar of graphic principles: Data-> Aesthetics ->Geometries->Visual
  
{g<- ggplot(data = your_data) + aes(x = variable1, y = variables2, variable3) + geom_something(decorate, colors, size.....) + additional_layers()}
  
  
  *Data*: Your dataset (census data, survey responses, etc.)
  *Aesthetics*: What variables map to visual          properties (x, y, color, size) - specific elements
  - x, y - position
  - color - point/line color
  - fill - area fill color
  - size - point/line size
  - shape - point shape
  - alpha - transparency
  
  *Geometries*: How to display the data (points, bars, lines)
*Additional layers*: Scales, themes, facets, annotations

###Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) Mindset
1. Load and inspect - dimensions, variable types, missing data
2. Assess reliability - examine margins of error, calculate coefficients of variation
3. Visualize distributions - histograms, boxplots for each variable
4. Explore relationships - scatter plots, correlations
5. Identify patterns - grouping, clustering, geographical patterns
6. Question anomalies - investigate outliers and unusual patterns
7. Document limitations - prepare honest communication about data quality

###join
    left join: preserve everything from the first table input, if right doesnt't provide-shows NA in the joined one
    right join: similar as the first one
    full join: with all the rows from both table
    inner join: only contain the row that in both table

*the column name doesn't have to be the same, but the data type need to be the same

## Questions & Challenges
- Which file I should go to when I make changes
- The whole process of making changes

## Connections to Policy
- Upload my work to my portfolio for visualization

## Reflection
- How different platform can connect and work with each other
- I want to practice more and dig deeper
