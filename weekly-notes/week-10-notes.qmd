## Key Concepts Learned
- Logistic regression is used when the outcome is binary (yes/no).
- Linear regression is inappropriate for binary outcomes because predictions can fall outside 0–1 and violate assumptions.
- Logistic regression models probabilities using the logistic function.
- Coefficients are interpreted on the log-odds scale; exponentiated coefficients become odds ratios.
- A probability threshold (such as 0.5) converts predicted probabilities into binary decisions.
- Confusion matrices summarize model performance using metrics like sensitivity, specificity, and precision.
- ROC curves and AUC evaluate overall discrimination across all possible thresholds.
- A model may perform differently across demographic groups, even when overall accuracy is high.

## Coding Techniques
- Fit logistic regression using `glm(..., family = "binomial")`.
- Use `predict(model, type = "response")` to obtain predicted probabilities.
- Create confusion matrices to calculate metrics such as sensitivity and specificity.
- Loop through multiple thresholds to evaluate different tradeoffs.
- Use `pROC::roc()` to create ROC curves and compute AUC.

## Questions & Challenges
- How to choose the optimal threshold for real-world decision making.
- Interpreting odds ratios correctly when predictors are on different scales.
- Understanding how different threshold choices influence false positives and false negatives.
- Assessing equity and subgroup performance in a structured way.

## Connections to Policy
- Logistic regression is widely used for risk assessment in criminal justice, health, and public services.
- Threshold decisions determine who receives interventions or additional scrutiny.
- Policymakers must consider the different costs of false positives versus false negatives.
- Fairness analysis is essential to ensure that models do not disproportionately burden certain groups.

## Reflection
- Logistic regression reframed prediction for me as a probability and decision problem, not just a statistical fit.
- Threshold selection is fundamentally a policy choice, not a purely statistical one.
- I will be more intentional about documenting threshold decisions and considering equity impacts in future analyses.
