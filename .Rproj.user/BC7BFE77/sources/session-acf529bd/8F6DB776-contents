## Key Concepts Learned
- Git is a version control system and GitHub is the cloud hosting of Git repositories.
-key concept in GitHub
  Repository (repo): Folder containing your project files
  Commit: Snapshot of your work at a point in time
  Push: Send your changes to GitHub cloud
  Pull: Get latest changes from GitHub cloud

## Coding Techniques
- [New R functions or approaches]
Tidyverse packages - table-> tibbles
library(tidyverse) to install 
Read in the tibbles: Car_data <- read_csv(weara.csv)
glimpse(car_data)
Select <- (name of the data,  the column name, column2)                  resign
filter(fga)  - not be saved
Old_cars <- filter(car_data, oldcars == ‘old’)                           
 us & for multi conditions- and;  | for or
mutate(name of the data, new column name = prices/1000)           add to table
Data_name <- rename(data_name, new name = ‘old name’)          rename column
Single quote if the old name contain space
new_data <- select(new_data, -select)                                             remove column
In the new name area:
Oldcars = case_when(age >20~“old”, TRUE ~ “not old”)                recode variables
Group by and summarize always go together
Avg_manufacturer <- car_data %>%
	group_by (manufacturer)%>%summarize(ave_price = mean(price))
%>% pipelines connect the codes

- [Quarto features learned]
Quarto is a publishing system combines code, text, output
