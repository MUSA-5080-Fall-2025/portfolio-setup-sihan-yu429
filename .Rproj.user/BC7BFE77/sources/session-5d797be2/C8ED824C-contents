## Key Concepts Learned
### What is An Algorithm
Definition: A set of rules of instructions for solving a problem or completing a task.
Application: Criminal Justice/Housing&Finance/Healthcare.

### Data analytics is Subjective
Every steps involves human choice embed human values and bias 
proxy don't understand background and history

### Group Challenge
Scenario: School enrollment assignment

Proxy: ZIP codes → stand-in for “assignment”
Blind spot:ZIP codes are not a direct measure of individual circumstances. They can mask or undercount diversity, education levels within households, and financial status differences across families in the same area.
Harm + Guardrail: Using ZIP code alone may reinforce existing segregation patterns, limit opportunities for disadvantaged students, and perpetuate inequities in school access.

### Why Censs Data Matters
- Understanding community demographics
- Allocate government resources
- Tracking neighborhood changes
- Designing fair algorithm

Most policy analysis happens at
- county level
- census track level
- block group level

Challenges & Concerns
- Most computing can “re-identify” individuals from census data/privacy
- solution: add noise to data set
- privacy vs accuracy

## Connections to Policy
Government using algorithm (Having limited budget and need to serve everyone)
- Efficiency: process more cases faster
- Consistency: same rules applied to everyone
- Objectivity: removes human bias
- Cost savings: fewer staff needed

## Coding Techniques
- Install packages
- Clean data

## Reflection
