## Key Concepts Learned
### spatial autocorrelation of the errors
1. random errors (good errors): 
- No systematic pattern
- Scattered across space
- Prediction equally good everywhere
- Model captures key relationships

2. Cluster errors (bad)
- Spatial pattern visible
- Under/over-predict in areas
- Model misses something about location
- Need more spatial features!

*spatial lag of errors*
- spatial lag = averrage value of neighbors
- create the spatial lag: my error vs avg error of 5r nearest neighbors

*Moran's I*
- +1 = Perfect positive correlation (clustering)
- 0 = Random spatial pattern
- -1 = Perfect negative correlation (dispersion)

- neighbors:
1. Contiguity: Polygons that share a border; Queen vs. Rook
2. Distance: All within X meters; Fixed threshold
3. k-Nearest" Closest k points; Adaptive distance

*spatial lag/error models*
- no spatial lag models for prediction: simultaneity problem; prediction paradox; data leakage in cv



## Coding Techniques
### library: spdep

## Questions & Challenges
- Which file I should go to when I make changes
- The whole process of making changes

## Connections to Policy
- Upload my work to my portfolio for visualization

## Reflection
- How different platform can connect and work with each other
- I want to practice more and dig deeper
